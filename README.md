## Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. Layoffs peaked in 2023, with a noticeable concentration in tech and media industries, likely due to economic adjustments of post-COVID.
2. The United States leads in layoffs, with major hubs like North America and Asia seeing significant impacts. Developing countries like Nigeria also experienced layoffs, due to lighting global economic challenges.
3. The tech industry accounted for 40% of total layoffs, followed by retail and media. This could be tied to over-hiring during growth periods and subsequent market corrections.

## Recommendations
---
1. Companies with higher funds raised should prioritize cash flow management and operational efficiency to avoid excessive layoffs.

2. Companies should align hiring decisions with sustainable, long-term growth strategies rather than short-term growth targets.

3. Industries with high layoff rates (e.g., tech and media) should adopt proactive measures, like cross-training employees to shift roles when needed.

4. Companies should monitor regional economic conditions and establish contingency plans for countries with a higher likelihood of layoffs (e.g., USA and specific global hubs).
